    In this project, Mr. Nabian simulated numerous real-world free-surface problems, such as dam-breaks, landslides, and other phenomena that are often induced by earthquakes. Based on these simulations, he devised an algorithm for simulating multiphase free-surface flows, which serves as a tool for simulating free-surface flow phenomena occurring in both industry and the natural world. He applied his algorithm, which he called the multiphase MPS method, to a number of real-world phenomena in order to verify its accuracy and illustrate some of its many applications. Further, Mr. Nabian built upon his original algorithm in order to develop a multi-resolution MPS method, which allows for the simulation of different types of fluid flow in different resolutions. He then confirmed that, compared to standard methods, Mr. Nabianâ€™s methods reduce the computation cost of free-surface flow simulation. As such, his work on this project has addressed one of the most crucial problems in the field with regard to computational fluid dynamics.
