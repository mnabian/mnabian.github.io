    In this project, I sought to improve the reliability analysis of transportation networks following extreme earthquake events. I have developed a novel deep learning method that accelerated seismic reliability analysis of large transportation systems. My contributions to this research include two different deep neural network models: a classifier model to speed up the connectivity determination of networks, and an end-to-end model to replace a group of modules in the transportation network reliability analysis pipeline. These models serve as useful tools for optimizing mitigation and preparedness procedures before extreme events happen, and also for improving emergency response after extreme events. I have ultimately developed a general framework for the accurate and accelerated seismic reliability analysis of transportation systems. This improved technique accounts for the inherent uncertainties in these systems and during earthquake events. This deep learning-based method exhibited improved performance over other machine learning-based reliability analysis techniques.

    In this research project, I have turned my focus to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which are useful for describing a variety of physical phenomena relevant to infrastructure analysis, including earthquake wave propagation and the prediction of traffic flow and fluid flow. The reliable analysis of these phenomena often requires taking into account the inherent randomness in the system. I have proposed new algorithms that make use of deep neural networks in order to improve upon conventional random PDE solution methods. Compared to previous approaches, my proposed methods are straightforward and achieve computational efficiency by optimizing the usage of advanced computer hardware, such as GPUs. These methods result in accurate solutions that have closed analytical forms and are thus able to be easily transferred to subsequent calculations. Moreover, these methods result in solutions that are real-time executable and thus are suited to the prediction of dynamic physical phenomena, such as traffic flow. While other solution methods are problem-dependent and suffer from the curse of dimensionality, my proposed algorithm is very well suited to different forms of random PDEs, and alleviates the curse of dimensionality issue. Ultimately, my proposed deep neural network modeling techniques offered a significantly beneficial approach to solving high-dimensional random PDEs common in engineering as well as a variety of other fields.

    In this project, I have contributed to the accurate simulation of numerous real-world free-surface problems, such as dam-breaks, landslides, and other phenomena that are often induced by earthquakes. Based on these simulations, I have devised an algorithm for simulating multiphase free-surface flows, which serves as a tool for simulating free-surface flow phenomena occurring in both industry and the natural world. I have applied his algorithm, which is called the multiphase MPS method, to a number of real-world phenomena in order to verify its accuracy and illustrate some of its many applications. Further, I have built upon my original algorithm in order to develop a multi-resolution MPS method, which allows for the simulation of different types of fluid flow in different resolutions. I have then confirmed that, compared to standard methods, the proposed methods reduce the computation cost of free-surface flow simulation. As such, my work on this project has addressed one of the most crucial problems in the field with regard to computational fluid dynamics.
