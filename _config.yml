  I am a PhD Candidate in Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure Systems program in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include <mark>infrastructure engineering</mark>, <mark>machine learning and deep learning</mark>, <mark>uncertainty quantification</mark>, <mark>computational statistics</mark>, and <mark>computational fluid dynamics</mark>. Primarily, I am interested in developing metamodels based on deep neural networks to accelerate stochastic computations in engineering systems, with applications in reliability analysis, design optimization, Bayesian inference, and computational fluid dynamics. Currently I am a member of the [Uncertainty Quantification group](http://publish.illinois.edu/meidani/).
